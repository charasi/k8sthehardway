Kubernetes The Hard Way (Automated)
This project aims to automate the process of setting up a Kubernetes cluster using the "Kubernetes The Hard Way" methodology, with the help of modern automation tools like Jenkins, Ansible, and Python.

By leveraging these tools, this approach allows you to:

Automatically provision and configure virtual machines or cloud instances.
Automate the installation and configuration of Kubernetes components (like etcd, kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, and kubelet).
Manage the complexity of networking, certificates, and authentication.
Monitor and validate the setup process using Jenkins pipelines and automation scripts.
